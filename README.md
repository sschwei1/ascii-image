# AsciiImage

AsciiImage was one of the first tasks i got when learning to code. It consists of 10 levels getting harder every time. Each level is built onto its last one. A long time ago I already completed all levels in C# and was very proud of myself, but since I just was a beginner, the code was very messy and not well structured. I though I take a 2nd go on it and complete it again in Java.

All levels can be found inside the `files` folder, starting with `A01` and ending with `A10`.
